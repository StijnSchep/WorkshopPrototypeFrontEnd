# Workshop Registering Prototype Front-End
Group project 1.4 - Web programming project using VueJS to create a prototype system where people can register themselves for workshops

The project was part of a group assignment at Avans University, year 1, period 4. The goal was to create a two-part system where an admin could add workshops and outsiders could register themselves for those workshops using a special code.

This is the Front-End of the application using VueJS.
